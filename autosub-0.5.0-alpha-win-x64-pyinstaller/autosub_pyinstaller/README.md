### Description

Autosub is an automatic subtitles generating utility. It can detect speech regions automatically by using Auditok, split the audio files according to regions by using ffmpeg, transcribe speech based on [Google-Speech-v2](https://github.com/gillesdemey/google-speech-v2)([Chrome-Web-Speech-api](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub/issues/1)) and translate the subtitles' text by using py-googletrans. It currently not supports the latest Google Cloud APIs.

The new features mentioned above are only available after autosub-0.5.0a (0.5.0-alpha). Not available on PyPI or the original repo.

### License

This repo has a different license from [the original repo](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub).

[GPLv3](LICENSE)

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FBingLingGroup%2Fautosub.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FBingLingGroup%2Fautosub)

### Dependencies

Autosub depends on these third party softwares or Python site-packages. Much appreciation to all of these projects.

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [auditok](https://github.com/amsehili/auditok)
- [pysubs2](https://github.com/tkarabela/pysubs2)
- [py-googletrans](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans)
- [langcodes](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/langcodes)
- [ffmpeg-normalize](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize)

Others see: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

About how to install these dependencies, see [Download and Installation](#download-and-installation).

<escape><a href = "#TOC">&nbsp;↑&nbsp;</a></escape>

### Download and Installation

Except the PyPI version, others include non-original codes not from the original repository.

After autosub-0.4.0, all of the codes is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3. It don't matter if you change the Python version in the installation commands below.

About the dependencies installation. If you install autosub by pip, ffmpeg and ffmpeg-normalize won't be installed together not like the Python site-packages already listed on the `setup.py` or `requirements.txt`. You need to install them separately. But of course they are optional. They aren't necessary if you only use autosub to translate your subtitles.

About the git installation. If you don't want to install git to use pip [VCS](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-support) support to install python package or just confused with git environment variables, you can manually click that clone and download button to download the source code and use pip to install the source code [locally](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#description) by input these commands.

```batch
cd the_directory_contains_the_source_code
pip install .
```

Due to the autosub PyPI project is maintained by the original autosub repo's owner, I can't modify it or upload a project with the same name. Perhaps later when this version of autosub becomes stabler, I will rename and duplicate this repo and then upload it to PyPI.

#### Branches

[alpha branch](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/tree/alpha)

- Include many changes from [the original repo](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub). Details in [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Codes will be updated when an alpha version have been released. It is stabler than the dev branch

[origin branch](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/tree/origin)

- Include the least changes from [the original repo](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub) except all new features in the [alpha branch](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/tree/alpha). The changes in [origin branch](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/tree/dev) just make sure there's no critical bugs when the program is running on Windows. Currently isn't maintained.

[dev branch](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/tree/dev)

- The latest codes will be pushed to this branch. If it works fine, it will be merged to alpha branch when new version released.
- Only used to test or pull request. Don't install them unless you know what you are doing.

#### Install on Ubuntu

Include dependencies installation commands.

Install from `alpha` branch.(autosub-0.5.0a)

```bash
apt install ffmpeg python python-pip git -y
pip install git+https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub.git@alpha ffmpeg-normalize
```

Install from `origin` branch.(autosub-0.4.0a)

```bash
apt install ffmpeg python python-pip git -y
pip install git+https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub.git@origin
```

Install from PyPI.(autosub-0.3.12)

```bash
apt install ffmpeg python python-pip -y
pip install autosub
```

<escape><a href = "#TOC">&nbsp;↑&nbsp;</a></escape>

#### Install on Windows

You can just go to the [release page](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/releases) and download the latest release for Windows. The click-and-run batches are also in the package. You can manually edit by using Notepad++. Or add the executable files' directory to system environment variables so you can use it as a universal command everywhere in the system if permission is Ok.

Tips: `Shift - Right Click` is the keyboard shortcut for opening a Powershell on current directory. To open an exe at current directory, the format is like `.\autosub`.

- The one without pyinstaller suffix is compiled by Nuitka. It's faster than the pyinstaller due to its compiling feature different from pyinstaller which just bundles the application.
- ffmpeg and ffmpeg-normalize are also in the package. The original ffmpeg-normalize doesn't have a standalone version. The standalone version of ffmpeg-normalize is built separately. Codes are [here](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/ffmpeg-normalize).
- If there's anything wrong on the both releases, or the package size and any other things are annoying you, you can just use the traditional pip installation method below.

Or install Python environment(if you still don't have one) from choco and then install the package.

Recommend using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) on windows to install the environment and dependencies.

Choco installation command is for cmd.(not Powershell)

```batch
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
```

Install from `alpha` branch.(autosub-0.5.0a)

```batch
choco install git python2 curl ffmpeg -y
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
pip install git+https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub.git@alpha ffmpeg-normalize
```

Install from `origin` branch.(autosub-0.4.0a)

```batch
choco install git python2 curl ffmpeg -y
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
pip install git+https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub.git@origin
```

PyPI version(autosub-0.3.12) is not recommended using on windows because it just can't run successfully. See the [changelog on the origin branch](CHANGELOG.md#040-alpha---2019-02-17) and you will know the details.

### Workflow

#### Input

A video/audio/subtitles file.

If it is a video or audio file, use ffmpeg to convert the format into [the proper one](https://github.com/gillesdemey/google-speech-v2#data) for API. Current default format for [Google-Speech-v2](https://github.com/gillesdemey/google-speech-v2) is 24bit/44100Hz/mono flac. API only accept mono audio files varied from the data from the repo mentioned above.

Also, you can use the built-in audio pre-processing function. The default [pre-processing commands](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub/issues/40#issuecomment-509928060) depend on the ffmpeg-normalize and ffmpeg. The commands include three commands. The [first](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AudioChannelManipulation) is for converting stereo to mono. The [second](https://superuser.com/questions/733061/reduce-background-noise-and-optimize-the-speech-from-an-audio-clip-using-ffmpeg) is for filtering out the sound not in the frequency of speech. The third is to normalize the audio to make sure it is not too loud or too quiet. If you are not satisfied with the default commands, you can also modified them yourself by input `-apc` option.

If it is a subtitles file and you give the proper arguments, only translate it by py-googletrans.

#### Split

Since this Speech-to-Text API only accept short-term audio which is not longer than [10 to 15 seconds](https://github.com/gillesdemey/google-speech-v2#caveats), we need to split one audio file into many small pieces which contain the speech parts. Autosub uses Auditok to detect speech regions.

Or uses external regions from the file that pysubs2 supports like `.ass` or `.srt`. This will allow you to manually adjust the regions to get better recognition result.

#### Speech-to-Text/Translation API request

Makes parallel requests to generate transcriptions for those regions.

- Manually post-processing for the subtitles lines may be needed, some of which are too long to be fitted in a single line at the bottom of the video frame.

At last, translates them to a different language, and finally saves the result subtitles to the local storage.

<escape><a href = "#TOC">&nbsp;↑&nbsp;</a></escape>

#### Speech-to-Text/Translation language support

The Speech-to-Text lang codes are different from the Translation lang codes due to the difference between these two APIs. And of course, they are in *Google* formats, not following the iso standards, making users more confused to use.

To solve this problem, autosub uses [langcodes](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/langcodes) to detect input lang code and convert it to a best match according to the lang code lists. Default it won't be enabled. To enable it in different phases, use `-bm all` option.

To manually match or see the full list of the lang codes, run the utility with the argument `-lsc`/`--list-speech-codes` and `-ltc`/ `--list-translation-codes`. Or open [constants.py](autosub/constants.py) and check.

To get a subtitles first line language, you can use `-dsl` to detect.

- Currently, if autosub is using [Google-Speech-v2](https://github.com/gillesdemey/google-speech-v2) as the method to transcribe, it allows to send the lang codes not from the `--list-speech-codes`, which means in this case the program won't stop.

- Though you can input the speech lang code whatever you want, need to point out that if not using the codes on the list but somehow the API accept it, [Google-Speech-v2](https://github.com/gillesdemey/google-speech-v2) recognizes your audio in the ways that depend on your IP address which is uncontrollable by yourself. This is a known issue and I ask for a [pull request](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub/pull/136) in the original repo.

- On the other hand, [py-googletrans](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans) is stricter. When it receive a lang code not on its list, it will throw an exception. Of course it can be designed as a throw-catch code block and ask user to input once again but currently I don't add this support so an improper translation lang code input will stop the program running unless you use the best match method mentioned above.

- Apart from the user input, another notable change is I split the `-S` option into two parts, `-S` and `-SRC`. `-S` option is for speech recognition lang code. `-SRC` is for translation source language. When not offering the arg of `-SRC`, autosub will automatically match the `-S` arg by using [langcodes](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/langcodes) and get a best-match lang code for translation source language though [py-googletrans](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans) can auto-detect source language. Of course you can manually specify one by input `-SRC` option. `-D` is for translation destination language, still the same as before.

#### Output

Currently support the following formats to output.

```Python
OUTPUT_FORMAT = {
    'srt': 'SubRip',
    'ass': 'Advanced SubStation Alpha',
    'ssa': 'SubStation Alpha',
    'sub': 'MicroDVD Subtitle',
    'mpl2.txt': 'Similar to MicroDVD',
    'tmp': 'TMP Player Subtitle Format',
    'vtt': 'WebVTT',
    'json': 'json(Only times and text)',
    'ass.json': 'json(Complex ass content json)',
    'txt': 'Plain Text(Text or times)'
}
```

Or other subtitles types/output modes, depend on what you need. More info in help message.

```Python
DEFAULT_MODE_SET = {
    'regions',
    'src',
    'dst',
    'bilingual'}

#### Internationalization

Autosub supports multi-language command line user interface by [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). Now supports `zh_CN` and default `en_US`. More info about this [lang codes format](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Locale-Names). The program will automatically detect the os locale and use the one supported. For windows 10, it seems adjusting the `Region`-`Regional format` is Ok.

Of course, autosub offers a method to override the os locale. Just create a txt file without extension named `locale`, containing the lang codes at the beginning of the file, at the command line current working directory. When autosub starts, it will detect this file and read the lang code inside it and apply it if supported.

If you want to translate this program into other languages, first install the gettext utilities. Then you can run `python scripts/update_po_files.py lang_code` to create the locale files which you want to translate into. And then use [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) to edit po files. [update_po_files.py](scripts/update_po_files.py) can also automatically merge the position info into the old po files and compile the po files into mo files which the program read them. So it's useful when the codes changed, you can merge the positional changes into the translations automatically.

### FAQ

#### Other APIs supports

[issue #11](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/issues/11), [issue 10](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/issues/10)

I won't add any new features unless I'm less busy in the future. However, pull requests are welcomed.

#### Batch processing

[issue #13](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/issues/13)

Same as above. Currently won't add it. You can use batch/powershell/bash to implement it.

Example for batch:(working at current directory)

```batch
@echo off
set "in_format=*.mp4 *.m4a"

@echo on
for /f "delims=^" %%i in ('dir /b %in_format%') do (
    autosub -i "%%i" ...(other options)
)
@echo off
```

If you want do a recursive walk through the directories, replace `'dir /b %in_format%'` with `'dir /b/s/a:-d %in_format%'` is Ok. [Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/dir).

#### proxy support

[issue #17](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/issues/17)

Currently I only implement the proxy settings in the same way as setting environment variables in the command line. So it is necessary for you to open a http/https proxy server locally like [shadowsocks-windows](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/releases) or [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/tree/master).

If you often encounter empty result or connection error during speech-to-text or subtitles translation, perhaps you need to get a better proxy for a better connection with Google or just rent a Linux server which can reach Google's network.

### Bugs report

Bugs and suggestions can be reported at [issues](https://github.com/BingLingGroup/autosub/issues).

### Build

I only write the scripts for building standalone executable files on windows, [Nuitka script](scripts/nuitka_build.bat) and [pyinstaller script](scripts/pyinstaller_build.bat).

Nuitka build is pretty tricky. I use anaconda as the package manager because [Nuitka readme](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka#id6) recommends using it. I use anaconda Python3.5 and [m2w64-gcc](https://anaconda.org/msys2/m2w64-gcc) to build. [m2w64-gcc](https://anaconda.org/msys2/m2w64-gcc) perhaps is the stablest 64bit C compiler on this specific case. Other C compiler or Python environment may fail to compile due to unknown reasons. And for those whose os language is not `en_US`, please set it to `en_US` and then start to build. Otherwise you will encounter this [known issue](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/193).

Pyinstaller build is more robust. No issues encountered when the spec file is written in the proper way.

[create_release.py](scripts/create_release.py) is used to make the two release packages. You need to create a `binaries` folder containing ffmpeg and ffmpeg-normalize executable files if you want to create a "fully" standalone release like the one I release. `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` are from [Zeranoe ffmpeg windows build](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). It should have the directory structure like this below.

```
binaries\ffmpeg.exe
binaries\ffprobe.exe
binaries\ffmpeg-normalize-Nuitka\ffmpeg-normalize.exe
binaries\ffmpeg-normalize-pyinstaller\ffmpeg-normalize.exe
```
